Prime numbers. We love them. You love them. Everyone loves them. But what do we all love more than prime numbers?

”𝑀𝓊𝒸𝒽 𝓅𝓇𝒾𝓂𝑒 𝓃𝓊𝓂𝒷𝑒𝓇𝓈”

𝑀𝓊𝒸𝒽 𝓅𝓇𝒾𝓂𝑒 𝓃𝓊𝓂𝒷𝑒𝓇𝓈 are numbers that are prime AND each of their rotations are also prime.
Some simple examples are: 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11.
Some more examples are: 13 (because 31 is also prime) and 197 (because 971 and 719 are also prime).
All 𝑀𝓊𝒸𝒽 𝓅𝓇𝒾𝓂𝑒 𝓃𝓊𝓂𝒷𝑒𝓇𝓈 below 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79 & 97

How many “much prime” numbers are there below 2 million?
